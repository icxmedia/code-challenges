# Take Home Challenge: Data Analysis and Visualization  
Analytics is about more than just numbers! At ICX, we take a holistic view of analysis, which includes gathering and interacting with data, performing statistical analyses, creating visualizations, and telling stories. For this challenge, you'll get to show off your end-to-end analytics chops! Here are the steps:  

## Get the Data  
This challenge comes with two datasets &mdash; the first of which contains information about YouTube videos (descriptions, engagement data, etc), and the second of which contains comments made in response to each video.

- [video_descriptions.csv](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1fLjYg1LYMHLvcH3siMt3HUNPoDkAzdBI)
- [video_comments.csv](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1jTcxhq_3UbRdOgL7eB4wLnjgLLjiXN5U)

## Explore the Data and Perform Statistical Analysis  
1. Load both datasets using your preferred tool (Jupyter notebook, RStudio, Excel, etc).
2. Come up with a method for filtering the video descriptions to find samples that are relevant to the movie "Ghostbusters".  
3. Come up with a method for filtering the video comments down to those that are relevant to "Ghostbusters".  
3. Compute the summary statistics for "Ghostbusters" videos and comments. This should include the number of videos, the unique number of video creators, the unique number of people commenting on "Ghostbusters" videos, and any other interesting stats!  
4. Describe some of your observations about people who comment on "Ghostbusters" videos and create a custom visualization (e.g. chart, diagram, graphic) to help present your analysis.  

## Data Visualization and Storytelling  
Imagine that your client is responsible for marketing a new "Ghostbusters" movie; they've asked you to produce a novel analysis to help inform the best audiences to reach and any other analysis that would help target their marketing effort. Come up with a slide deck (~5-10 slides) that effectively communicates the results of your analysis and conveys the takeaways that are most relevant to your client's business problem(s).
