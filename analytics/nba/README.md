# Take Home Challenge: Data Analysis and Visualization

Analytics is about more than just numbers! At ICX, we take a holistic view of analysis, which includes gathering and interacting with data, performing statistical analyses, creating visualizations, and telling stories. For this challenge, you'll get to show off your end-to-end analytics chops! Here are the steps:

## Download the Data

## Explore the Data and Perform Statistical Analysis
Given a dataset of NBA players performance and salary in 2014:
1. Load the dataset using your preferred tool (Jupyter notebook, RStudio, Excel, etc)
2. Compute the summary statistics for the `SALARY` field (e.g. mean, median, mode, maximum, minimum)
3. Create a custom visualization to describe the relationship of player efficiency (PER) to salary.

## Data Visualization and Storytelling
Imagine that your client is an owner for one of the middle-tier teams; they've asked you to produce a novel analysis to help inform their upcoming 2020-2025 recruitment budget planning meeting. Come up with a slide deck (~5-10 slides) that effectively communicates the results of your analysis and conveys the takeaways that are most relevant to your client's business problem(s).
